## Progressive Federated Dictionary Learning

### Abstract
This research presents an innovative method for federated learning that integrates dictionary learning approaches to tackle intra-class variation. Based on the concept of curriculum learning, we provide a gradual approach to dictionary learning that enhances the initialization of the dictionary in each local model. The process involves developing a neural network ar- chitecture using Convolutional Neural Networks in a federated learning configuration, where a curriculum is applied separately to each client. The global model combines local dictionaries by making use of averaging techniques, hence improving the repre- sentation of attributes throughout the full federated dataset. The experimental findings validate the effectiveness of the suggested methodology, wherein the integration of curriculum learning leads to enhanced precision. The study also compares the results obtained with and without the utilisation of dictionary learning and curriculum learning, demonstrating the beneficial influence on the performance of the model.
